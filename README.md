# GoMeCoMa
*This project was abandoned because of dependency hell. Never trust other peoples code*
Go Media Collection Manager borns from the combination of a wish and a need. I really
wished that for a Movie Collection Manager that would be clean, open source and integration
friendly. Many of the options where old, bad maintained(not that this project is different),
close sourced or simply bad solutions.

Besides that, I actually need to learn Go and improve my skills with it and needed a project
to help me with that. This is a great project but not to far from reality, so help me God.

## Intentions

* Create a Media Manager with modern funtionalities like:
  * Importing(Read media from disk and add it to db)
  * Media scrapping(Consume external APIs to gather missing data)
  * Trakt integration(Sync watched status with external manager)
  * VLC integration(Open file directly from the manager)
  * OpenSubtitles Integration(Search for subtitles directly from the browser)
* Incorporate a REST API for easy integration of other services
* WebUI for better compatibility and remote access
* Support multiple kinds of media:
  * Movies
  * TV Shows
  * Music
  * Pictures(Maybe)
* Try to support custom media for applications like:
  * Card collections
  * NFT collections
  * Book collections
  * Any kind of asset that you like to catalogue

## Roadmap

- [ ] Core application for Movie and Music cataloging
- [ ] Initial API implementation
- [ ] Initial WebUI implementation
- [ ] Media importing implementation
- [ ] Media scraping
- [ ] More stuff later...
